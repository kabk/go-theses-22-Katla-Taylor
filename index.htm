			<h2 id="intro">Introducing Non-Human Travellers</h2>

			<p>
				Narrating the history of <em>Lupinus Nootkatensis</em> in Iceland presents a case study of struggle at various levels. History of unsustainable practices. The analysis of a specific case such as the Lupina will serve as an introduction to a global phenomenon — adaptation to ecosystem imbalance. The choice of the main character in this tale is related to my own personal circumstances. I grew up in France with British and Icelandic parentage. Through my multinational background, I was entitled to the Icelandic nationality in the form of a legal document. A passport issued by the national government was handed to me as an official travel document, granting me the possibility to travel across human made borders. This convenient document allows me to move freely between European states since Iceland is included in the Schengen agreement, and acquire visas fairly easily to travel across
          <span class="sidenote">The Icelandic passport currently ranks on the 11th place according to the Guide Passport Ranking Index.</span> the globe.<span class="footnote-anchor"></span>
      	By inheriting these privileged rights, I confer certain advantages in this time of globalisation. The question of nationality has shifted since borders between nations have been opening up amid the ongoing acceleration of globalisation. Advances in transportation and technology have radically increased the exchange of goods <br><em>“pictured as the threads of an immense spider web formed over millennia […] People, money, material goods, ideas, and even disease and devastation have traveled these silken strands, and have done so in greater numbers and with greater speed than ever before in the present age.”</em> <span class="sidenote">National Geographic Society. “Globalization.” National Geographic Society, 9 Oct. 2012, www.nationalgeographic.org<br>/encyclopedia/globalization/.</span><span class="footnote-anchor"></span><br>
				The phenomena is perfectly illustrated by the current COVID-19 pandemic that has quickly spread worldwide. For my line of enquiry, I could have chosen from many themes and examples, however, I deliberately decided to limit my investigation to rarely discussed non-human travellers. While some migrations follow the seasons, others are the result of involuntary dislocation to unfamiliar habitats. Many perish, but others survive or even flourish in the new environment. <em>Lupinus Nootkatensis</em> is an example of the latter, having been deliberately introduced from Alaska to Iceland.<br><em>Lupinus Nootkatensis</em> is the protagonist around which I chose to elaborate my narrative. The plant develops into a dynamic character in the course of my story as it develops to bring in different genres from historical to fiction then develops into a thriller ending on a mystery case.
				<br><br>Through deconstructing the anatomy of the plant, by examining its physical properties and by redefining events and making new associations, I would like to introduce an array of interrelated topics that mirror to some extent the complexity of ecosystems themselves. In this way, I question the terms: “sustainable”, “parasite”, “invasive” and “natural”. These terms are globally established but convey different meanings locally.<br><br>
				Returning to Lupina, we can start by considering the soil on which it grows to elaborate on the history of the colonisation of the Icelandic landscape. This leads us to multi-species interaction by taking the example of the root nodules system, formed through multi-species interdependence. The uptake of minerals relies on systems of transport and structural support provided by the stem, which I have used as a metaphor to look at migration and rules brought in to mitigate invasive species. The reproductive system or flower is an emblematic visual signal – of which the distinctive purple colour is transforming the landscape and the way it is perceived.  
        <br><br>My study will take the form of a collection of short stories <br>– as the flower unfolds.<br>

				Once the plant has established a root system, it cannot cross borders, migrate or relocate. The story is therefore set in a predefined environment dictated by past events.<em>“[The plants] Their absence of movement is nothing but the reverse of their complete adhesion to what happens to them and their environment.”</em>

			Lupinus Nootkatensis thrives in the Northern Hemisphere. In Iceland, it has settled in a fragile, geologically recent landscape which has been exposed to massive alteration. The island is regarded as extremely young geologically, and the formation of its soils date back only 10,000 years.

      The ecosystem is influenced by the warm Gulf Stream. It is home to volcanoes that are dynamic, erupting or slumbering, glaciers that have formed and retreated, and unstable weather patterns. The sculpted landscape has resulted in microclimates most sensitive to any disturbance, where it is key to keep a balance to sustain a coexistence between individual species, be they organic, an-organic, human or animals etc.. No wonder NASA selected Iceland as a destination for the members of the Apollo mission to the moon for field training in 1965 and 1967.

			<em>“[NASA] was looking for places that would roughly approximate the geological features of the moon,”</em> says Stephen Garber. A barren, fragile, newly-formed volcanic terrain most sensitive to any disturbance.
